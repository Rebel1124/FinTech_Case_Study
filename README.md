**What is the background of your company? What do they do? Who are their competitors?**

Apple Pay is arguably the leading mobile payment and digital wallet service. It allows users to make payments in person, in iOS apps, and on the web. It is supported on the iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, and Mac.

**How does this company use technology to their advantage? Why are they considered a FinTech company?**

This is an important example of how a leading tech company is moving into consumer finance in a big way, using their existing iPhone/iPad/Mac platform and existing Apple Store relationships to gain market share. And Apple Pay is hugely successful: well over a billion Apple Pay transactions took place in the
second quarter of 2018, and more mobile transactions took place that quarter using Apple Pay than PayPal.

Also notable are the reasons why Apple Pay is so successful; namely, that

* *It seems to be more secure than a traditional credit card.*
* *It is possible to store additional information that can be needed for certain transactions, such as driverâ€™s license information to verify age when purchasing alcoholic beverages.*
