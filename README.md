**What is the background of your company? What do they do? Who are their competitors?**

Apple Pay is arguably the leading mobile payment and digital wallet service. It allows users to make payments in person, in iOS apps, and on the web. It is supported on the iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, and Mac.

<br/><br/>

**How does this company use technology to their advantage? Why are they considered a FinTech company?**

This is an important example of how a leading tech company is moving into consumer finance in a big way, using their existing iPhone/iPad/Mac platform and existing Apple Store relationships to gain market share. And Apple Pay is hugely successful: well over a billion Apple Pay transactions took place in the
second quarter of 2018, and more mobile transactions took place that quarter using Apple Pay than PayPal.

Also notable are the reasons why Apple Pay is so successful; namely, that

- _It seems to be more secure than a traditional credit card._
- _It is possible to store additional information that can be needed for certain transactions, such as driverâ€™s license information to verify age when purchasing alcoholic beverages._

<br/><br/>

**Why is this company exemplary in the FinTech space? What are their strengths and weaknesses?**

**_Strengths:_**

- Apple is an aggressive corporate strategist that utilizes acquisition based monpolization to increase their foothold in the tech space. This is no exception in their takeover of the Fintech space. For instance, most recently Cook acquired Credit Kudos (a UK firm) with the intent on using their services to circumvent traditional banks/credit check processes to verify customers credit-worthiness. Couple this with their expanding Apple Pay system, would enable them to act essentially as a capital lending company, similar to how a bank currently operates. SaaS based credit platforms allow them to operate with more steady & forward looking cash-flow streams, whereby they can further strategize their next business moves far in advance.

- Other stregnths include their already entrenched grasp of the tech/computer industry with 560M+ global users, of which ~50M+ are already active users of Apple Pay. The networking effect of gaining net Apple Pay users from their core user base seems inevitable.

- Apple is already developing third party tech software/hardware to further reduce reliance on third-parties. Presumably, under proper management, this will save capital outflows in the medium/long term timescales.

**_Weaknesses_**

- Apple still has the daunting task of catching up with bank leader's on hand capital as they currenty don't have access to borrowing prime rates & cash flow/derivative hoards that major banks still enjoy the advantage of.

<br/><br/>

**What is the prognosis for this company? Where do they expect to be in the future?**

- Apple is well poised, especially during larger interest rate environment periods like now, to solidify their near monopoly status by having access to their large cash stores without having to take debt/loan at higher fed rates. They will be a global leader in tech & continue to expand their fintech branch well into the middle/later half of the 21st century.
